Because I have come to the fence at night,   
the horses arrive also from their ancient stable.   
They let me stroke their long faces, and I note   
in the light of the now-merging moon  
  
how they, a Morgan and a Quarter, have been   
by shake-guttered raindrops   
spotted around their rumps and thus made   
Appaloosas, the ancestral horses of this place.  
  
Maybe because it is night, they are nervous,   
or maybe because they too sense   
what they have become, they seem   
to be waiting for me to say something  
  
to whatever ancient spirits might still abide here,   
that they might awaken from this strange dream,   
in which there are fences and stables and a man   
who doesnâ€™t know a single word they understand.
